        <h3> What are Semantic Elements?</h3>
        <p> Semantic Elements are used because they have a define the context, of what
         is contained between their opening and closing tags.
        Non-Semantic Elements include<span class="fontchange"> &lt;div&gt;</span> and 
        <span class="fontchange">&lt;span&gt;</span> elements. 
        These elements do not give any hint as to what will be contained 
        between their opening and closing tags.
        They simply change the way in which the content is presented. 
    </p> 
</div>
<div id="block2"> <h3> Benefits of using Semantic Elements:</h3> 
          <ul>
            <li>Better Search Engine Optimization </li>
            <li> Easy to understand for other developers</li>
            <li> Easier to read for screenreaders, which enabled the visually impaired to have access to your content</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="block3">
        <h4  class="attri"> Attributes</h4>
<p> Some elements allow for what is called an <span class="attri"> attribute.</span>
 
An <span class="attri"> attribute</span> provides additional information about an element. 
For example if you are considering placing an image on your page, you will 
have to use the <span class="fontchange">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag. 
Its a self-closing tag, but you will need to include the <span class="attri"> src= attribute</span> in the opening tag. 
This enables you to include the address of the image you are trying to 
add to your page.
All <span class="attri">attributes </span>are placed in the opening tag of an element.

An <span class="attri">attribute </span> keyword is usually followed by an equals = sign, which then lists any values the attribute requires,
like a name or sizing info.</span>
 Other <span class="attri"> attributes </span> include <span class="attri"> id </span> and
 <span class="attri"> class</span>, which are CSS selectors. 
 There are also <span class="attri">height</span> and 
 <span class="attri">width attributes</span>  that allow you to resize your image. 
<span class="attri">attributes.</span></p>
